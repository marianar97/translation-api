### Create Translation Job

```http
POST /translations/job/
```

Request body:
```json
{
    "duration": 30.5,
    "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/callback"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "id": "97fabbb7-6f5c-49f0-964d-cf7feca5642c",
  "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/callback",
  "created_at": "2024-11-07T00:53:39.054062Z",

}
```

## Webhook Notifications

Upon job completion or error, the service will send a webhook notification to the specified URL with the following payload:

```json
{
  "job_id": "e39e4668-ea7a-4fea-af92-efd65200a256",
  "status": "completed",
  "created_at": "2024-11-07 00:39:06.562608+00:00",
  "event_type": "translation.status_update"
}
```

The webhook service includes:
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts
- Exponential backoff between retries
- 5-second timeout for each attempt
